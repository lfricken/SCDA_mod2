To start the editor, you need to run a command prompt and do launch arguments like this (this is assuming the Editor.exe is in your system folder):
EditMap ..\Packages\01\MapsPC\ind01_VS.sds
EditMap ..\Packages\02\MapsPC\ind02_VS.sds
EditMap ..\Packages\03\MapsPC\ind03_VS.sds
EditMap ..\Packages\04\MapsPC\frq01_VS.sds
EditMap ..\Packages\05\MapsPC\frq02_VS.sds
EditMap ..\Packages\06\MapsPC\shp_VS.sds
EditMap ..\Packages\07\MapsPC\shp02_VS.sds
EditMap ..\Packages\08\MapsPC\ind04_VS.sds
